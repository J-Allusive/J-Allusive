Hello my name is J-Allusive
I am interested in coding and bypassing network restrictions etc
my specialties are HTML CSS JAVASCRIPT and PYTHON I can also code in BASIC and BASH as well as RUST
I make my projects for the heck of it but also because some people use open source software to keep their minds off of their problems... (Couldent be me)
